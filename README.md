# Flow Editor for WordPress

A visual, spatial canvas view for WordPress Site Editor — see your entire site as a connected system.

## Status

**In Design** — See [design document](docs/plans/2026-01-28-flow-editor-design.md)

## Concept

Instead of editing one page at a time, Flow Editor lets you:
- Zoom out to see all pages, patterns, and template parts on an infinite canvas
- See connection lines showing which patterns are used where
- Double-click to edit in the native block editor
- Return to the canvas with changes reflected

## Inspiration

Based on ideas from [Building the Web Beyond One Screen at a Time](https://designomattic.wordpress.com/2026/01/28/building-the-web-beyond-one-screen-at-a-time/) by Tino Barreiro.
